# Hand-Tracking-with-MediaPipe-and-GIF-Output
This repository contains a Python script that uses MediaPipe to perform real-time hand tracking via a webcam and saves the output as a GIF. The script leverages OpenCV for video capture and ImageIO for GIF creation, making it a lightweight solution for visualizing hand movements.
